# Linked

## What it is

**Interaction pattern:** Linked gives authors a reusable move when building explorables. It encodes *when* to use interaction, not just *what* to animate.

## When to use

- Learner must feel consequence before naming the rule
- Parameter space is low-dimensional but insight is high
- Narrative and mechanics reinforce each other

## When to avoid

- Concept is purely definitional with no dynamic
- Interaction adds chrome without changing beliefs

## Implementation notes

| Element | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| First screen | Minimal text; one manipulable |
| Reveal | After commit, show formal statement |
| Replay | Reset + randomize seed |

## Example explorables

- [[parable-of-polygons]] — reference implementation

## Pair with

- [[pricing]]
- [[principle-2]]
- [[priority]]

## Discovery suggestions

- [ ] Link to three THY nodes that use this pattern
