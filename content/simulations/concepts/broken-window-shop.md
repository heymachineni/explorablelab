# The Broken Window Shop

> **Tagline:** Interactive treatment of the broken window shop—behavior must be felt, not summarized.

## Theory

- [[calculus-2]]
- [[capacity]]
- [[cas9]]

## Core interaction

Users manipulate the smallest set of parameters that produces surprise. Default path: naive play → contradiction → named rule → sandbox.

## Build spec

| Layer | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Model | Transparent update rules |
| UI | One dominant control per act |
| Narrative | BUT-chain between acts |

## Anti-patterns

- Text wall before first interaction
- Animation without user agency

## Discovery suggestions

- [ ] Prototype stub (PRT) when composite ≥ 8.5
